Todo:
- Continue to tidy up the resources:
	- Change the way tilemaps are loaded (use a tilemap designer program)
	- Maybe move animations out of resources, since they aren't really resources: they aren't loaded.
	- Make the description of irregular spritesheets neater.
- Test out the compound entity:
	- Check it works
	- Improve it, by allowing individual control of the sprites. The compound sprite will be a transformable,
	  and this transform is applied to the sprites. However, the sprites should also be transformable, to
	  change their relative position.
- Add more entities and add collision events:
	- Add some events for collisiosn between non-solid entities.
	- Add some events for collisions with solid entities (not tilemap).
	(Note: I don't need accurate physics)
